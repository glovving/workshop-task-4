# workshop-task-4
# Interactivity
## The goals for this weeks workshop tasks:
- Create an interactive p5.js sketch with at least three different kinds of user input events.
- Experiment with ways to record and redeploy inputs from the user.
- Make a new repository for your p5.js project on your GitHub account, publish your sketch as a webpage, and include a README file in your repository with a URL to the webpage along with documentation of your work.

## Notes and Planning
Here are the notes I took during the workshop tutorial video, I used them as a quick referencing while writing my code

For planning my sketch, I began with writing down a basic idea of what I wanted which is shown below.

My initial plan was to have an angel character which would personally address the user, asking for some personal input (names, message, etc.), then the angel would quiz the user, depending on the results of this quiz the user would end up with different 'end' scenarios.
I wanted this sketch to feel videogame-like, by using an illustrated character, presenting the user a challenge, and having multiple endings based on user input.

## Creating my Sketch
I began working on this sketch by creating my angel character, which I made using simple shapes and the pen tool on paint 3d, which is a free windows program.

I chose to create my image using a digital program in order to emphasise the digital environment of my sketch.

### Code Layout
The layout of my code is very similar to last weeks workshop, declaring many global variables
